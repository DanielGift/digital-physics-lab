Repo for physics-related simulations for my classes. Projects are often in ongoing development, and are built in collaboaration with AI. I'm exploring using AI tools to augment my teaching as well as learning how to use them on my own. I believe that physics can be best taught visually and intuitively, and I want these simulations and games to help with that!
